## Overview (In progress)

This project is an ongoing effort to build a Voice Detection App that listens to audio input, transcribes it into text, and identifies the type of voice (for example: male, female, child, or animal etc etc)....

The app's initial version uses basic technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Web Speech API for speech-to-text conversion. However, we are now integrating Machine Learning tools and libraries to enhance its ability to accurately classify voices.


### Features(planned)
1. Real-time voice detection: Detect whether the speaker is a human, child, male, female, or an animal.
2. User-interface: Simple design for easy interaction.
3. Speech-to-text transcription: Converts voice input into text
4. Accurate voice classification: AI/ML-based voice analysis.Accurate voice classification: AI/ML-based voice analysis.


### How it works 
1. Voice Recognition: The app uses the browser's built-in speech recognition API (Web Speech API) to listen and transcribe voice input.
2. Voice Type Detection: Based on the text from the transcription, the app tries to determine the type of voice (e.g., "human", "dog", "unknown").
3. Output: Displays the transcription and the detected voice type below the microphone button.


### Technologies used(so far):

Frontend:
1. HTML, CSS: For structure and styling.
2. JavaScript: For interactivity and logic.
3. Web Speech API: For speech-to-text conversion.
Machine Learning (In Progress):
2. TensorFlow.js (Client-side ML) or Python ML libraries for backend integration.
3. Datasets: Audio datasets for training and testing the model.


### How to use:
git clone https://github.com/dushyant4665/BroDetectsEverything-voiceDetection_AI
cd BroDetectsEverything-voiceDetection_AI



This project is a work in progress. The AI/ML-based voice detection feature is under development and will be integrated soon.
