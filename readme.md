## Overview (In progress)

Working on(A Voice Detection App). This app listens to sounds, turns them into text, and figures out what kind of voice it is—like if it’s a man, woman, child, or even an animal!

Built a simple version using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and something called the Web Speech API to help with turning speech into text. But now, adding some cool Machine Learning tools to make the app even better at recognizing and classifying different voices.

That's detect what kind of voice it is 
like Human, animal, or etc etc...

### Features(planned)
1. Real-time voice detection: Detect whether the speaker is a human, child, male, female, or an animal.
2. User-interface: Simple design for easy interaction.
3. Speech-to-text transcription: Converts voice input into text
4. Accurate voice classification: AI/ML-based voice analysis.Accurate voice classification: AI/ML-based voice analysis.


### How it works 
1. Voice Recognition: The app uses the browser's built-in speech recognition API (Web Speech API) to listen and transcribe voice input.
2. Voice Type Detection: Based on the text from the transcription, the app tries to determine the type of voice (e.g., "human", "dog", "unknown").
3. Output: Displays the transcription and the detected voice type below the microphone button.


### Technologies used(so far):

Frontend:
1. HTML, CSS: For structure and styling.
2. JavaScript: For interactivity and logic.
3. Web Speech API: For speech-to-text conversion.
Machine Learning (In Progress):
2. TensorFlow.js (Client-side ML) or Python ML libraries for backend integration.
3. Datasets: Audio datasets for training and testing the model.


### How to use:
git clone https://github.com/dushyant4665/BroDetectsEverything-voiceDetection_AI
cd BroDetectsEverything-voiceDetection_AI



This project is a work in progress. The AI/ML-based voice detection feature is under development and will be integrated....

I'm working on it
